  <div class="history">ABOUT OUR STORY<br><br>
    Many years ago, in the tropical lands of Brazil, Souza's Ice Cream was born, a small family business with big ice cream dreams. The sweet aroma of fresh ice cream began to envelop the streets, as the Souza family passionately dedicated themselves to producing small but delicious ice cream units. Back then, each spoonful carried not only the refreshing flavor, but also the warmth and dedication of a family passionate about what they did.

    Over time, the impeccable quality and unparalleled flavor of Souza's ice creams won hearts and palates across the country. Demand grew, and the small company became a medium-sized powerhouse in the world of ice cream, always maintaining the artisanal touch and family affection.</div>
